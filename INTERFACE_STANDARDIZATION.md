# Interface Standardization

## Overview

This document describes the interface standardization work being done as part of Phase 6 (Codebase Diet). The goal is to standardize interfaces across all contexts to improve code consistency, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Interfaces

The following standard interfaces have been defined:

- **ContextDependencies**: Provides a consistent pattern for dependency injection
- **StorageAccess**: Standardizes storage operations across contexts
- **FormatterAccess**: Standardizes formatter operations across contexts
- **ServiceAccess**: Standardizes service resolution across contexts
- **ExtendedContextInterface**: Adds dependency injection support

### 2. Comprehensive Interfaces

Building on the core interfaces, we've defined composite interfaces that combine functionality:

- **FullContextInterface**: Combines all core interfaces into a complete context interface
- **FullMcpContextInterface**: Extends FullContextInterface with MCP functionality

### 3. Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

- **Interface Segregation**: Following the Interface Segregation Principle to avoid forcing clients to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Incremental Implementation**: Updating contexts one at a time to minimize disruption
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring strong typing throughout with proper generics
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining backward compatibility during the transition

## Implementation Status

- [x] Define core interfaces
- [x] Update BaseContext with standardized interfaces
- [ ] Update ConversationContext implementation
- [ ] Update ProfileContext implementation
- [ ] Update NoteContext implementation
- [ ] Update ExternalSourceContext implementation
- [ ] Update WebsiteContext implementation
- [ ] Update test mocks to follow new interfaces

## Reference Materials

1. `interface-implementation-plan.md`: Detailed plan for implementing interfaces across contexts
2. `interface-implementation-example.md`: Example implementation of standardized interfaces

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All contexts will follow the same interface patterns
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is defined once
3. **Better Typing**: Improved type safety through consistent generics usage
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Standardized mocking approach
5. **Clearer Contracts**: Explicit interfaces make expectations clearer

## Next Steps

1. Implement interfaces for one context at a time, following the plan
2. Update tests to use the new interfaces
3. Fix any type errors or test failures
4. Document the new interfaces and their usage
