# ProfileContext Refactoring Design - COMPLETED ✅

This document outlined the design for refactoring the ProfileContext class to improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

**Status: COMPLETE ✅**

The ProfileContext class (originally 725 lines) has been successfully refactored into a lightweight facade over specialized services with better separation of concerns.

## Implementation Results

The refactoring has been successfully completed with:
- New directory structure created in `/src/mcp/contexts/profiles/`
- ProfileFormatter class extracted
- MCP resources and tools extracted into dedicated files
- Core ProfileContext implemented as a facade
- Import references updated throughout the codebase
- All tests passing with the refactored code

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a focused responsibility
2. **Enhanced Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation
3. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Simplified Dependency Management**: Clear dependency flow between components
5. **More Flexibility**: Services can be extended or replaced independently

## Next Steps for Future Development

When enhancing profile functionality:
1. Identify the specific service responsible for the feature
2. Extend that service with the new functionality
3. Update the facade if necessary to expose new capabilities
4. Add tests for the new functionality
