# Documentation Plan - COMPLETED ✅

This plan outlined how documentation was updated during the refactoring process to ensure it stayed in sync with the code.

**Status: COMPLETE ✅**

All planned documentation updates have been incorporated into:
- JSDoc comments in refactored code
- Updated README.md with new architecture details
- Specialized documentation in `/docs/` directory
- System diagrams and implementation details

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is now organized as follows:

1. **Code Documentation**
   - JSDoc comments integrated directly into the codebase
   - Interface and type definitions with comprehensive descriptions
   - Function and method docs detailing parameters, returns and exceptions

2. **Architecture Documentation** 
   - Component diagrams in README.md
   - Specialized technical docs (TIERED_MEMORY.md, TEST_ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
   - Implementation details in specific README files per component

3. **User Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
   - Command reference table
   - Installation and configuration guides

## Reference for Future Documentation Updates

For any future development work, follow these guidelines:

1. Update JSDoc comments for all new code
2. Add any new commands to the README.md command reference tables 
3. For significant architectural changes, create dedicated .md files in `/docs/`
4. Keep examples updated to reflect current functionality
5. Add integration test coverage for new features

See the [README.md](../README.md) for comprehensive project documentation.
