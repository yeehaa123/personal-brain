# Personal Brain Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Personal Brain project, focusing on enhancing personal knowledge management with AI conversations.

## Recently Completed

1. ✅ **BrainProtocol Refactoring**: Modularized the BrainProtocol into specialized components with clear responsibilities
2. ✅ **Tiered Memory System**: Implemented sophisticated conversation memory with three tiers for optimized token usage
3. ✅ **Conversation Summarization**: Added AI-powered summarization of older conversation turns
4. ✅ **Enhanced Context Management**: Improved context handling with automatic tier transitions
5. ✅ **Conversation to Notes Integration**: Implemented functionality to convert conversations to permanent notes
6. ✅ **Matrix Interface Improvements**: Enhanced the Matrix chat interface (ongoing)

## Current Priorities

1. **Database-backed Memory Storage**: Implement persistent storage for conversation memory
   - Move from in-memory to database storage
   - Support archiving and retrieval of old conversations
   - Implement cross-conversation knowledge transfer

2. **Memory Usage Optimization**: Implement token counting for precise context management
   - Add token counting to replace turn counting for memory management
   - Optimize prompt formatting based on token usage
   - Add intelligent context selection based on relevance and token limits

3. **Matrix Interface Enhancements**: Continue improving the Matrix interface
   - Support Markdown rendering in Matrix
   - Add image embedding in responses
   - Improve formatting of citations and external sources

4. **Integration with PKM Tools**: Add support for other personal knowledge management tools
   - Implement import/export for tools like Obsidian or Logseq
   - Support standard markdown formats with frontmatter
   - Create bidirectional linking capabilities

## Future Development

### Knowledge Visualization

1. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Create visualizations of connections between notes and concepts
   - Implement relationship tracking between notes
   - Create a simple graph visualization component
   - Support filtering and exploration of the knowledge graph

2. **Cross-reference Discovery**: Automatically identify and suggest connections between related notes
   - Implement semantic similarity detection between notes
   - Add suggestion system for related notes during note creation
   - Support manual confirmation of suggested connections

3. **Semantic Navigation**: Navigate between related concepts and notes using semantic similarity
   - Create concept nodes from notes and conversations
   - Implement semantic-based navigation commands
   - Support "similar to this" and "related to" queries

### Content Enhancements

1. **Advanced External Sources**: Integrate additional knowledge sources beyond Wikipedia and News API
   - Add support for research papers and preprints
   - Integrate with specialized knowledge bases
   - Implement better source filtering and relevance detection

2. **Multimodal Support**: Add ability to store and reference non-text content
   - Implement image storage in the database
   - Add image references in note content
   - Support basic image viewing in the CLI and Matrix interfaces
   - Add PDF and audio file support

3. **Data Management Features**: Add capabilities for data maintenance
   - Implement data export functionality
   - Add backup and restore capabilities
   - Create data migration tools

### Long-term Vision

1. **Personal Knowledge Assistant**: Proactively suggest relevant notes based on context
   - Monitor active work context
   - Implement anticipatory suggestions
   - Support contextual awareness across sessions

2. **Timeline Views**: Visualize the evolution of knowledge and concepts over time
   - Track concept development over time
   - Create timeline visualization of note creation and updates
   - Support versioning of knowledge

This roadmap will evolve as development progresses and new priorities emerge. The focus remains on creating a cohesive experience between conversations and notes, optimizing memory usage, and enhancing the overall knowledge management capabilities.
