# Phase 5 Implementation Plan

## Progress

1. ✅ Update imports in entry points (index.ts, cli.ts, matrix.ts)
2. ✅ Fix all command handlers to use IBrainProtocol instead of BrainProtocol
3. ✅ Merge ContextOrchestrator and ContextOrchestratorExtended functionality
   - Already implemented in existing ContextOrchestrator
4. ✅ Replace remaining BrainProtocol imports with IBrainProtocol
   - Updated all entry points to use IBrainProtocol interface
5. ✅ Rename BrainProtocolIntegrated to BrainProtocol
   - Changed approach: Enhanced existing BrainProtocol directly
6. ✅ Remove the old BrainProtocol implementation
   - Changed approach: Kept single implementation with integrated functionality
7. ✅ Run final tests to ensure everything works

## Entry Points
- ✅ /home/yeehaa/Documents/personal-brain/src/index.ts
- ✅ /home/yeehaa/Documents/personal-brain/src/cli.ts
- ✅ /home/yeehaa/Documents/personal-brain/src/interfaces/matrix.ts

## Implementation Notes

The original plan involved creating separate `ContextOrchestratorExtended` and `BrainProtocolIntegrated` classes, but the implementation approach was changed. Instead:

1. The existing `ContextOrchestrator` was enhanced directly with messaging functionality
2. The existing `BrainProtocol` was enhanced to implement the complete `IBrainProtocol` interface

This approach is simpler and more maintainable as it avoids duplicate implementations and provides a cleaner transition to the new architecture.

## Tests Affected
- All passing ✅

## Next Steps
Move on to Phase 6: Codebase Diet, which involves:

1. Simplifying interfaces by removing redundant methods
2. Consolidating similar functionality across contexts
3. Completing remaining dependency injection implementations
4. Standardizing ResourceRegistry and ServiceRegistry implementations
