## Implementation Approach

### 1. Legacy Code Removal (Priority: High)

Identify and remove all remaining legacy code, compatibility layers, and transitional adapters:

- Remove all code marked with `@deprecated` comments
- Remove all transitional adapters and intermediary layers
- Eliminate any remaining technical debt and workarounds
- Update imports and references to use the new standardized structure

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Use `bun run find-deprecated` to identify and remove all deprecated methods:
   - Remove deprecated methods in StatusManager
   - Remove deprecated methods in ProfileSearchService (`src/services/profiles/profileSearchService.ts`)
   - Remove deprecated methods in NoteSearchService (`src/services/notes/noteSearchService.ts`)

2. Use `bun run find-dead-code` to systematically identify and remove dead exports:
   - Focus on files with multiple unused exports
   - Prioritize cleaning up the core modules first
   - Look for patterns of dead code in related modules

3. Use `bun run lint:fix` with the newly added unused-imports plugin to clean up unused imports:
   - Run periodically during the cleanup process
   - Will automatically remove imports that aren't being used
   - Particularly useful after removing unused exports

4. Review code marked for removal:
   - Remove transitional adapters in protocol messaging
   - Update configuration handling in config.ts
   - Clean up legacy error handling in various components

### 2. Dependency Injection Completion (Priority: High)

Building on the work from Phase 6, we'll complete the dependency injection implementation across all components:

- Standardize factory methods (`getInstance`, `resetInstance`, `createFresh`, `createWithDependencies`) across all remaining classes
- Remove any direct instantiations of dependencies in constructors
- Update all tests to properly mock dependencies using the standardized pattern
- Ensure all classes follow the Component Interface Standardization pattern
- Implement proper dependency resolution throughout the codebase

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Complete `createWithDependencies` implementation in smaller utility classes
2. Update repository implementations to follow the standardized pattern
3. Update service implementations to use dependency injection consistently
4. Standardize dependency resolution in factory methods
5. Ensure all tests use standardized mock implementations

### 3. Error Handling Refinement (Priority: Medium)

Implement a consistent error handling approach across all components:

- Standardize error types and error handling patterns
- Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
- Enhance error logging with contextual information
- Ensure all async operations have proper error boundaries

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Standardize AppError usage throughout the codebase
2. Implement consistent try/catch patterns in async operations
3. Enhance error logging with contextual information
4. Create error recovery mechanisms for critical operations
5. Update error handling documentation

### 4. Documentation Completion (Priority: Medium)

Complete comprehensive documentation for the architecture and components:

- Update architecture diagrams to reflect the new simplified structure
- Document component interactions and dependencies
- Create developer guides for key subsystems
- Update contributing guidelines with standardized patterns

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with final architecture decisions
2. Document Context standardization in CONTEXT_STANDARDIZATION.md
3. Update component interaction diagrams
4. Create developer guides for each major context
5. Document error handling patterns and best practices

## Testing Strategy

1. Maintain high test coverage throughout the codebase
2. Update tests to reflect new dependency injection patterns
3. Implement integration tests for critical workflows
4. Ensure all components have unit tests for error conditions
