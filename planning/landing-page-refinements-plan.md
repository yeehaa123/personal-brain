## Content Quality Assessment System

A key component of the enhanced landing page system will be the content quality assessment logic:

1. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Content completeness (all required fields populated)
   - Minimum content length thresholds
   - Marketing language assessment
   - Structure and formatting correctness
   - Relevance to section purpose

2. **Section Visibility Rules**:
   - Each non-critical section has a quality threshold
   - Sections falling below threshold are automatically disabled
   - Critical sections (Hero, Services, CTA) are always shown with fallback generation
   - Adjacent sections adjust layout when sections are omitted

3. **Quality Improvement Workflow**:
   - System identifies low-quality sections
   - Offers targeted regeneration of those sections
   - Provides editing interface for manual enhancement
   - Suggests additional profile/brain data to improve generation

## Detailed Section Implementation Specs

### Hero Section
- Strong headline limited to 10 words
- Subheading limited to 25 words
- Clear CTA button text (3-5 words)
- Option for background image or illustration
- **Always shown - critical section**

### Problem Statement
- Title that resonates with target audience pain points
- 2-3 paragraph description of challenges addressed
- Optional bullet points (3-5) highlighting specific issues
- **Conditionally shown - requires clear problem articulation**

### Services Overview

- Each service has: title, brief description, optional icon
- Clickable for more detailed information
- **Always shown - critical section**

### Process Section

## Acceptance Criteria

For this enhancement to be considered complete:

1. All high-priority sections (Hero, Problem Statement, Services, Social Proof, CTA) must be fully implemented
2. Medium-priority sections should have basic implementation
3. The landing page must be responsive and display correctly on mobile devices
4. Users must be able to edit and customize all sections via CLI and Matrix interfaces
5. **The system must intelligently omit sections with insufficient/low-quality data**
6. Preview functionality must accurately represent the final published page
7. Generated content must be professional and appropriate for service businesses
8. The overall design must present a cohesive, professional appearance **regardless of which sections are shown**

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Advanced theme customization options
- Multiple layout variants for each section
- Integration with external image libraries
- Analytics tracking for page performance
- A/B testing capability for different headlines and CTAs

| **Poor user experience with missing sections** | **High** | **Medium** | **Design layouts specifically for various section combinations; prioritize critical sections** |
| Mobile responsiveness complexity | Medium | Medium | Use proven responsive patterns; leverage CSS grid and flexbox; implement thorough testing |
| Template customization scope creep | High | High | Strictly define customization parameters; focus on content rather than design in first iteration |
| Integration with existing website structure | Medium | Low | Maintain consistent API; ensure backward compatibility; thorough testing |
| Performance issues with complex sections | Medium | Low | Optimize image loading; implement lazy loading; minimal JavaScript |
| **Layout issues when sections are omitted** | **Medium** | **High** | **Create adaptable spacing system; test with all possible combinations of visible sections** |

## Conclusion

This enhancement will transform the basic landing page functionality into a powerful service marketing tool that effectively showcases consultants' and professionals' services. By implementing a structured, section-based approach with conditional rendering based on content quality, we will create much more effective landing pages that help convert visitors into clients while gracefully handling variations in available content.
