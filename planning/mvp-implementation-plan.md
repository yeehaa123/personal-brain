## Scope Change Process

If a change to the MVP scope is considered necessary:

1. **Document the requested change**:
   - What is the change?
   - Why is it needed for the MVP?
   - What impact will it have on timeline?

2. **Evaluate against criteria**:
   - Is it truly blocking the MVP's core value proposition?
   - Can it be deferred to post-MVP?
   - Does it increase timeline by more than 20%?

3. **Decision**:
   - If the change is critical to MVP value and cannot be deferred, adjust scope but remove something else of equivalent effort
   - If the change can be deferred, add to post-MVP roadmap
   - Document all decisions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Website Context components
- Command handlers
- Content transformation logic
- GitHub Pages integration

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end flow from profile data to landing page
- Command execution in both CLI and Matrix

### Manual Tests
- Visual inspection of landing page
- Deployment verification

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| MCP architecture refactoring complexity | High | Low | ✅ Completed with Component Interface Standardization pattern |
| Breaking changes from refactoring | High | Low | ✅ Completed with backward compatibility maintained |
| BrainProtocol decomposition impact | Medium | Low | ✅ Completed with incremental changes and robust test coverage |
| Astro integration complexity | Medium | Low | Start with minimal Astro setup before content generation (already mitigated) |
| Profile data transformation edge cases | Medium | Medium | Add extensive testing for various profile formats |
| Command interface inconsistencies | Low | Medium | Create strong abstractions for both interfaces |
| Scope creep | High | High | Strictly follow this document, regular scope checks |
| MCP Inspector compatibility | Medium | Low | ✅ Completed with compatibility verified during Component Interface Standardization |

## Success Metrics

How we'll measure the success of the MVP:

1. **Functional Completeness**: All MVP features working as specified
2. **Time to Website**: Time taken to go from profile data to published website
3. **Profile Data Coverage**: Percentage of profile data preserved in landing page
4. **User Effort**: Number of commands needed to complete core workflows
5. **Quality**: Number of bugs found post-MVP release

## Post-MVP Priorities

These items are explicitly planned for after the MVP and should not be included in the initial release:

1. Blog publishing system for notes
2. SEO optimization features
3. Content scheduling
4. Analytics integration
5. Theme customization options
6. Conversation Schema Refactoring
7. Database-backed Memory

## Conclusion

This plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Personal Brain MVP with a focused scope. By removing blog capabilities from the MVP and focusing solely on the landing page generation, we've significantly reduced the scope while maintaining the core value proposition.

The MVP now includes the MCP architecture refactoring as a core component, which will provide a solid foundation for future features. By phasing this refactoring across the remaining MVP timeline, we ensure that we can complete the essential architectural improvements without delaying the overall timeline.

The completed protocol response simplification and deployment architecture work provide a strong foundation, and the planned refactoring will further improve the codebase structure. This comprehensive approach ensures that we deliver a high-quality MVP with both user-facing features and a robust architectural foundation.
