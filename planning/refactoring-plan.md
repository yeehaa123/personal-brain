# Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the three largest files in the Personal Brain project to improve maintainability, extensibility, and testability.

## Files to Refactor

1. **profileContext.ts** (725 lines)
2. **brainProtocol.ts** (528 lines)
3. **commands/index.ts** (603 lines)

## General Approach

For each file, we will:

1. Create a modular directory structure
2. Split responsibilities into focused components
3. Establish clear interfaces between components
4. Preserve existing functionality
5. Maintain or improve test coverage

## Implementation Order

We propose the following implementation order:

1. **ProfileContext Refactoring**
   - Relatively self-contained
   - Will establish patterns for the other refactorings
   - Has the clearest separation of concerns

2. **Commands Refactoring**
   - More complex but with clear domain separation
   - Will improve extensibility for future commands
   - Key for implementing conversation-to-notes features

3. **BrainProtocol Refactoring**
   - Most complex due to its central role
   - Benefits from patterns established in previous refactorings
   - May require adjustments to both ProfileContext and Commands

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md with new architecture details
   - Update class and module documentation
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Ensure code comments reflect the new structure

## Phase 1: ProfileContext Refactoring

See [profile-refactoring.md](./profile-refactoring.md) for detailed design.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create directory structure in `/src/mcp/contexts/profiles/`
2. Extract the ProfileFormatter class
3. Extract MCP resources and tools
4. Create the core ProfileContext facade
5. Update import references throughout the codebase
6. Run tests and fix any issues
7. Update documentation with new structure
8. Create detailed class diagrams for the new modules

**Expected Timeline:** 1-2 days

## Phase 2: Commands Refactoring

See [commands-refactoring.md](./commands-refactoring.md) for detailed design.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create directory structure in `/src/commands/`
2. Create base command handler and types
3. Extract each command group to its own handler
4. Implement the main command handler
5. Update import references throughout the codebase
6. Run tests and fix any issues
7. Update command documentation in README.md
8. Document the command extension pattern for future developers

**Expected Timeline:** 2-3 days

## Phase 3: BrainProtocol Refactoring

See [brain-protocol-refactoring.md](./brain-protocol-refactoring.md) for detailed design.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create directory structure in `/src/mcp/protocol/`
2. Extract configuration management
3. Implement specialized managers for contexts, conversations, etc.
4. Break down query processing pipeline
5. Create the streamlined BrainProtocol class
6. Update import references throughout the codebase
7. Run tests and fix any issues
8. Update MCP architecture documentation
9. Create query processing pipeline diagram
10. Document manager interactions and responsibilities

**Expected Timeline:** 3-4 days

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test each new component in isolation
   - Ensure proper mocking of dependencies

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Focus on key paths through the system

3. **System Tests:**
   - Ensure end-to-end functionality is preserved
   - Test with real data and dependencies

4. **Regression Testing:**
   - Run all existing tests against the refactored code
   - Ensure no regressions in functionality

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality
   **Mitigation:** Comprehensive test coverage, incremental changes, thorough code review

2. **Risk:** Introducing new bugs
   **Mitigation:** Start with smaller, more focused refactorings, extensive testing

3. **Risk:** Degraded performance
   **Mitigation:** Performance testing before and after refactoring

4. **Risk:** Increased complexity from additional files
   **Mitigation:** Clear documentation, consistent naming conventions, centralized exports

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass after refactoring
2. No degradation in functionality
3. Code is more modular and maintainable
4. Each file is under 300 lines
5. Clear separation of concerns
6. Improved extensibility for future features

## Future Work

After completing these refactorings, we recommend:

1. Implementing database-backed conversation storage
2. Completing conversation-to-notes integration
3. Enhancing token usage optimization
4. Implementing full tiered memory persistence

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan will significantly improve the maintainability and extensibility of the Personal Brain project. By breaking down large files into focused components, we'll establish a more modular architecture that will better support future development.
