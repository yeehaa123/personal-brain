# Vercel AI SDK MCP Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines two potential approaches for integrating the Vercel AI SDK's MCP tools support with our Personal Brain project:

1. **Phased Integration**: Gradually add Vercel AI SDK's MCP client capabilities alongside our existing implementation
2. **Complete Migration**: Fully migrate from our custom MCP implementation to Vercel AI SDK's MCP tools

This plan will be implemented after the MVP phase is complete, providing standardized connectivity between our MCP server and the Vercel AI SDK.

## Background

Our Personal Brain project currently uses a custom MCP implementation that includes:
- A comprehensive set of contexts (Notes, Profiles, Conversations, Website, etc.)
- Both HTTP/SSE and StdIO server implementations
- A robust BrainProtocol orchestration layer

The Vercel AI SDK recently added experimental support for MCP tools, which could provide standardized ways to connect our MCP server with various AI models and tools. While we've already migrated our Claude model to use the Vercel AI SDK, we have not yet integrated with their MCP tools support.

## Goals

1. **Standardize AI Interactions**: Use industry-standard approaches for AI model interactions
2. **Reduce Custom Code**: Lower maintenance burden by leveraging Vercel's implementation
3. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Position for deeper integration as Vercel's MCP support matures
4. **Maintain Features**: Preserve all current capabilities regardless of approach

## Implementation Details

### Phased Integration: Vercel MCP Client Adapter

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import type { MCPClient, MCPTransport } from 'ai';

export interface VercelMcpClientOptions {
  transport: {
    type: 'sse' | 'stdio';
    url?: string; // Required for SSE
  };
  apiKey?: string;
}

export class VercelMcpClient {
  private static instance: VercelMcpClient | null = null;
  private client: MCPClient | null = null;
  private schemas: Record<string, any>;
  
  /**
   * Get singleton instance
   */
  public static getInstance(options?: VercelMcpClientOptions): VercelMcpClient {
    if (!VercelMcpClient.instance) {
      VercelMcpClient.instance = new VercelMcpClient(options);
    }
    return VercelMcpClient.instance;
  }
  
  /**
   * Reset singleton instance
   */
  public static resetInstance(): void {
    if (VercelMcpClient.instance?.client) {
      VercelMcpClient.instance.close();
    }
    VercelMcpClient.instance = null;
  }
  
  /**
   * Create fresh instance
   */
  public static createFresh(options?: VercelMcpClientOptions): VercelMcpClient {
    return new VercelMcpClient(options);
  }
  
  /**
   * Private constructor
   */
  private constructor(options?: VercelMcpClientOptions) {
    this.schemas = this.buildSchemas();
    this.initialize(options);
  }
  
  /**
   * Initialize client
   */
  private async initialize(options?: VercelMcpClientOptions): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  /**
   * Build schemas for our MCP tools
   */
  private buildSchemas(): Record<string, any> {
    return {
      'create_note': {
        parameters: z.object({
          title: z.string().describe('Title of the note'),
          content: z.string().describe('Content of the note'),
          tags: z.array(z.string()).optional().describe('Tags for the note')
        })
      },
      // Other tool schemas...
    };
  }
  
  /**
   * Get tools
   */
  public async getTools(): Promise<any> {
    if (!this.client) throw new Error('Client not initialized');
    return await this.client.tools({ schemas: this.schemas });
  }
  
  /**
   * Close client
   */
  public close(): void {
    if (this.client) {
      this.client.close();
      this.client = null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Complete Migration: Core Architecture

```typescript
import { experimental_createMCPClient, experimental_createMCPServer } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

/**
 * Base Context class using Vercel AI SDK
 */
export abstract class BaseContext {
  protected server: any; // Vercel MCP Server
  protected resources: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  protected tools: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  
  constructor(protected options: any = {}) {
    this.initialize();
  }
  
  protected initialize(): void {
    // Initialize context...
  }
  
  public registerOnServer(server: any): boolean {
    if (!server) return false;
    
    this.server = server;
    
    // Register resources
    for (const [name, resource] of this.resources.entries()) {
      server.addResource(name, resource);
    }
    
    // Register tools
    for (const [name, tool] of this.tools.entries()) {
      server.addTool(name, tool);
    }
    
    return true;
  }
  
  // Other common methods...
}

/**
 * Unified MCP Server using Vercel AI SDK
 */
export function createUnifiedMcpServer(options: any = {}): any {
  const server = experimental_createMCPServer({
    name: options.name || 'PersonalBrain',
    version: options.version || '1.0.0',
  });
  
  // Initialize contexts
  const noteContext = NoteContext.getInstance();
  const profileContext = ProfileContext.getInstance();
  const conversationContext = ConversationContext.getInstance();
  // Other contexts...
  
  // Register contexts
  noteContext.registerOnServer(server);
  profileContext.registerOnServer(server);
  conversationContext.registerOnServer(server);
  // Other contexts...
  
  return server;
}
```

## Comparison of Approaches

### Phased Integration

**Pros:**
- Lower risk with incremental changes
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Allows selective adoption of Vercel features
- Easier rollback if issues arise
- Can validate Vercel's implementation before full commitment
- Keep using custom features not supported by Vercel's implementation

**Cons:**
- Longer time period with duplicate code
- Higher maintenance burden during transition
- More complex architecture during transition
- Potential inconsistencies between approaches
- Technical debt from supporting both implementations

### Complete Migration

**Pros:**
- Clean, consistent architecture
- Reduced long-term maintenance burden
- Full standardization on Vercel AI SDK
- Simpler codebase after migration
- Clearer documentation and usage patterns
- Better alignment with industry standards

**Cons:**
- Higher risk due to large-scale changes
- Potential loss of custom functionality
- Dependency on experimental features
- More difficult rollback if issues arise
- Steeper learning curve for team
- Longer period where system may be unstable

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Vercel MCP API changes | High | Medium | Create loose coupling, version pinning |
| Missing functionality | High | Medium | Extend Vercel's implementation as needed |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Benchmark before/after, optimize |
| Breaking existing functionality | High | Medium | Comprehensive test suite, phased rollout |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Low | Isolate dependencies, version management |
| Experimental feature stability | High | High | Add fallback mechanisms for critical features |

## Decision Framework

To decide between phased integration and complete migration, consider:

1. **Project Timeline**
   - Phased: Longer overall timeline but less disruption
   - Complete: Shorter total timeline but more intense disruption

2. **Team Resources**
   - Phased: Can be implemented with fewer resources at once
   - Complete: Requires dedicated team focus during migration

3. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Phased: Lower risk with clear fallback options
   - Complete: Higher risk but cleaner final result

4. **Feature Requirements**
   - Phased: Better for preserving custom features
   - Complete: Better for standardization and simplicity

5. **Vercel AI SDK Maturity**
   - Current status: Experimental (higher risk for complete migration)
   - Future consideration: Re-evaluate when no longer experimental

## Timeline Comparison

| Approach | Total Time | Team Impact | Stability During Development |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Phased Integration | 10 days (spread over time) | Lower | Higher |
| Complete Migration | 15 days (concentrated) | Higher | Lower |

## Recommendation

We recommend postponing the final decision between phased integration and complete migration until:

1. The MVP phase is complete
2. Vercel AI SDK's MCP support has been more thoroughly evaluated
3. Project timeline and resources have been reassessed

However, regardless of approach, we should begin the assessment and exploration phase immediately after MVP completion to gather data for an informed decision.

## Success Criteria

Regardless of approach, the integration will be considered successful when:

1. All existing functionality is preserved
2. Vercel AI SDK's MCP tools can be used with our system
3. All tests pass with the new implementation
4. Documentation is updated to reflect changes
5. No performance degradation compared to current implementation
6. Maintainability is improved

## Conclusion

Both approaches have merit, and the final decision should be based on a careful evaluation of project needs, team capacity, and the maturity of Vercel AI SDK's MCP support after MVP completion. This planning document provides a framework for both approaches, enabling an informed decision when the time comes.
