Generate a Call-to-Action (CTA) section for a professional website. This section should encourage visitors to take the next step and contact {{name}}.

Include:

1. **Title**: A compelling headline for this section (e.g., "Ready to Get Started?", "Let's Work Together")
2. **Subtitle** (optional): A brief supporting message that adds urgency or value
3. **Button Text**: Clear, action-oriented text for the CTA button
4. **Button Link**: Where the button should direct users (typically #contact or similar)

Keep the content professional, direct, and aligned with the profile:

Name: {{name}}
Tagline: {{tagline}}

Return ONLY valid JSON with keys for: title, subtitle (optional), buttonText, buttonLink, and enabled (set to true).
