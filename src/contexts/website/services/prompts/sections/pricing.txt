2. **Introduction** (optional): A brief statement about pricing approach
3. **Pricing Tiers**: 2-4 different service packages or tiers, each with:
   - Name: Package or tier name

   - Features: List of 3-6 specific inclusions
   - Featured status: Whether this is the recommended or featured package
   - CTA Text: Button text for this tier
