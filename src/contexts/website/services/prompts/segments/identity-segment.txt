# Identity Segment Generation

You are generating the core identity segment for a professional landing page. This segment establishes the essential personality and value proposition of the person/organization.

## Your task:

Generate a compelling identity segment that includes:
1. Professional title and tagline that captures essence
2. A powerful hero section with headlines and subheadings
3. A problem statement that identifies audience pain points

Use the information from my notes, articles, and profile to create authentic positioning that genuinely represents my work and approach. Focus specifically on what makes my approach unique and how I help solve specific problems for clients.

## Requirements for the identity segment:

**Title & Description:**
- Create a professional title that captures expertise (e.g., "Strategic Innovation Consultant" or "Ecosystem Design Specialist")
- Write a concise yet descriptive meta description (1-2 sentences) for SEO that explains core value proposition

**Tagline:**
- Short, memorable phrase that encapsulates unique approach or philosophy
- Should be inspiring and reflect key values/differentiators

- Subheading: 1-2 sentences elaborating on headline, focusing on transformation offered
- Call-to-action text and link target that motivates immediate engagement
- (Optional) Image URL suggestion if readily available

**Problem Statement:**
- Title that names the challenge/gap in the market
- Description paragraph explaining the problem from audience perspective
- 3-4 clear bullet points highlighting specific pain points experienced by ideal clients
- Should create tension that your services will resolve

## Response Format:
