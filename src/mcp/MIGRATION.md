# Model Context Protocol Integration

This document outlines the integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into the Personal Brain application.

## Current Progress

1. ✅ Installed the MCP SDK package
2. ✅ Created a basic NoteContext implementation using the MCP 
3. ✅ Made the new implementation a drop-in replacement for the original NoteContext
4. ✅ Updated the BrainProtocol class to use the new implementation
5. ✅ Added a README.md with next steps and usage instructions
6. ✅ Verified the application runs with the new implementation
7. ✅ Migrated ProfileContext to MCP
8. ✅ Migrated ExternalSourceContext to MCP
9. ✅ Streamlined directory structure for all contexts
10. ✅ Created Unified MCP Server for all contexts
11. ✅ Modified context classes to support external server registration
12. ✅ Added tests for the unified MCP server
13. ✅ Implemented Transports
14. ✅ Updated BrainProtocol to Use Unified Server
15. ✅ Added MCP Server CLI Interface
16. ✅ Consolidated test imports to use new structure
17. ✅ Consolidated all MCP code into a single directory
18. ✅ Marked migration as complete

## Migration Status: COMPLETE ✅

All MCP functionality has been successfully migrated to the new architecture with a unified MCP server. The key accomplishments include:

- Created a consolidated MCP structure under src/mcp
- Implemented a unified MCP server that combines all context resources
- Added proper transport mechanisms (StdioServerTransport, SSEServerTransport)
- Organized code into logical modules (contexts, protocol, model)
- Fixed all tests to use the new structure
- Created barrel files (index.ts) for simplified imports
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

## Next Steps for Future Development

1. Add Type Safety Improvements
   - Add stronger typing for MCP resources and tools
   - Complete JSDoc documentation for all MCP-related functions

2. Add More MCP Features
   - Implement more advanced MCP features like tool factories
   - Add support for streaming responses

3. Add More Transport Options
   - Implement WebSocket transport
   - Explore other transport mechanisms

4. Performance Optimizations
   - Optimize resource and tool registration
   - Improve caching for external sources
