headline: Ecosystem Architect | Black Ocean Navigator | Innovator
summary: >-
  I am an entrepreneur, thinker, and coder. Nowadays, I like to call myself an
  ecosystem architect. This means that I bring people together around common
  values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into effective
  ecosystems.


  My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn and
  challenging preconceived, ill-informed notions about education. With
  Offcourse, I aim to create an ecosystem of people and tools that focus on open
  and transparent knowledge sharing, instead of credentials, ego, and
  intellectual property.


  In 2021, I created the Superconnectors event format, enabling startups to
  present their 'critical ask' to the best-connected people in the Dutch tech
  ecosystem.


  I hold a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Utrecht and have worked as a
  researcher and teacher at several traditional (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam,
  Minneapolis) and non-traditional (DevBootcamp San Francisco) schools. I also
  founded the Innovator's Working Group of the Dutch Internet Society and was
  actively involved in the Public Spaces Coalition. I strongly advocate for an
  impactful and inclusive internet.


  I currently work and live in Taipei, Taiwan.

      As Founder of Rizom, I'm creating a community where individuals are
      empowered to discover and develop their unique strengths and passions. Our

      societal transformation and sustainable financial success. 


      Rizom connects people around shared values and translates collective
      vision into tangible impact, building on my experience as an ecosystem
      architect. We're reimagining how communities can thrive through meaningful

    title: Founder and Chief Vision
    description: >-
      Superconnectors is an event where startups can find the right solution to
      their most critical ask with the help of a Superconnector. This could be
      an introduction to someone in a specific market, to the right investor, to
      someone with unique knowledge or someone with exceptional access to
      talent.


      Founders pitch their most critical ask to a group of Superconnectors. The
      Superconnectors then compete for the best connection to solve their ask!
      The startups will decide who can help in the best way.


      As Founder and Chief Vision, I focus on scaling Superconnectors without
      watering down what made the concept a success in the first place: a
      genuine desire to maximize return on ecosystems.

    title: Bots With an Attitude
    description: Bots with an attitude is a project for Planet B from Waag. Planet B
      is a mission to recolonise planet Earth based on a narrative of DIY
      expeditions to a fictional planet. The project ‘Bots with an attitude’ is
      a support system for artistic researchers, who work or wish to work with
      machine learning and AI. The bots are personal assistants. They help by
      gathering information or helping publish the artist's work. However, they
      are unusual bots, because they have a character and mind of their own,
      leading to unexpected encounters and, hopefully, productive surprises.

      started with crowdlearning; sharing what they have learned and learning

    It’s been an absolute pleasure to know and work with Jan Hein for the past
    few years. His patience while coaching and pair programming with me has been
    instrumental to my learning of new technologies. The fact that Jan Hein is
    always taking the initiative to help others, share his knowledge, all while
    maintaining a genial and welcoming attitude makes him one of my favorite
    people to collaborate with. Any team would be lucky to have him on board!
  - >-
    Nicholas Jayanty




    Jan Hein is a force of nature. His ability to connect with people, his
    technical skill, and his aptitude and fearlessness when it comes to
    developing and exploring innovative concepts is truly special.  Emotional
    intelligence that is off the charts makes Jan Hein a dynamic and inspiring
    colleague and collaborator.
