My work focuses on designing decentralized and regenerative systems that transcend traditional organizational models.\n\nWith a PhD in Philosophy from Utrecht University, I've worked as a researcher and teacher at several institutions including Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Minneapolis. My journey has led me from traditional academia to founding multiple innovative ventures including Rizom, Superconnectors Network, and previously Offcourse.\n\nMy approach combines philosophical depth with practical implementation, focusing on four key movements: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out. I believe in creating systems that work in less mechanical, less hierarchical ways - fostering collaboration over competition.\n\nCurrently based in Taipei, Taiwan, I continue to challenge preconceived notions about education, technology, and community building. My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn and creating ecosystems that focus on open knowledge sharing rather than credentials and intellectual property.",

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing virtual spaces where people can come together around shared values. Unlike traditional organizational design, ecosystem architecture works bottom-up rather than top-down, focusing on creating environments where complex systems can emerge and thrive across space and time. I help organizations build decentralized, regenerative ecosystems that transcend traditional spatial and temporal boundaries."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does your ecosystem architecture process work?",
        "answer": "My process follows four key movements: 1) Align - defining values and creating a vision type, 2) Validate - testing commitment through vessels of transformation, 3) Scale - iteratively growing toward a minimum viable ecosystem, and 4) Spin Out - letting the ecosystem thrive independently. Throughout this process, we'll work collaboratively to ensure your ecosystem reflects your unique values and goals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to develop an ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem development is not a linear process with a fixed timeline. Unlike traditional projects, ecosystems emerge and evolve organically. That said, we typically see meaningful progress through the alignment and validation phases within 3-6 months. Building toward a minimum viable ecosystem often takes 1-2 years, depending on complexity and scale. I'll work with you to establish realistic milestones while maintaining the flexibility needed for organic growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of organizations benefit most from ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "Organizations that thrive with ecosystem architecture are those looking to move beyond hierarchical structures toward more organic, decentralized models. This approach is particularly valuable for innovation communities, educational initiatives, tech platforms seeking to build genuine communities, and organizations navigating fragmented digital landscapes. If you're seeking to create lasting transformation rather than just building products or services, ecosystem architecture may be right for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes your approach to ecosystem architecture unique?",
        "answer": "My approach draws from diverse disciplines including philosophy, coding, media theory, and regenerative design. With experience founding multiple ecosystem-based initiatives like Rizom and the Superconnectors Network, I bring both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills. I'm particularly focused on helping organizations navigate our fragmented internet landscape while building resilient, purpose-driven communities that can transcend traditional spatial and temporal limitations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer consulting or implementation services?",
        "answer": "I offer both strategic consulting and hands-on implementation support. Some clients prefer guidance as they implement ecosystem architecture principles themselves, while others want more direct involvement in building their ecosystem. We can discuss your specific needs and create a customized engagement that provides the right level of support for your organization."
