My work focuses on designing decentralized and regenerative systems that transcend traditional organizational models.\n\nWith a PhD in Philosophy from Utrecht University, I've worked as a researcher and teacher at several institutions including Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Minneapolis. My journey has led me from traditional academia to founding innovative ventures like Rizom, where I'm creating a community that empowers individuals to discover their unique strengths and drives positive societal transformation.\n\nThroughout my career, I've developed frameworks that challenge conventional thinking about organization and innovation. My approach blends philosophical inquiry with practical implementation, focusing on four key movements: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out. This methodology helps communities and organizations transcend spatial and temporal limitations to create thriving ecosystems.\n\nI believe that true innovation is not about creating waste but transforming it into opportunity. By embracing both decentralization and regenerative design principles, I help organizations move beyond extraction mindsets toward collaborative, sustainable futures.\n\nCurrently based in Taipei, Taiwan, I continue to explore how ecosystem architecture can address our most pressing challenges by fostering resilience, diversity, and interconnectedness across communities worldwide.",

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing intentional communities and organizations that transcend traditional spatial and temporal boundaries. Unlike biological ecosystems, modern ecosystems can be distributed across space and time, connecting people through shared values rather than physical proximity. As an ecosystem architect, I help bring people together around common values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into effective, decentralized, and regenerative ecosystems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is your approach to ecosystem design?",
        "answer": "My approach follows four key movements: 1) Align - defining values and creating a vision type, 2) Validate - testing commitment through vessels of transformation, 3) Scale - iteratively growing toward a minimum viable ecosystem, and 4) Spin Out - letting the ecosystem thrive independently. This process blends decentralized and regenerative design principles, working bottom-up rather than top-down to cultivate systems that emerge organically yet purposefully."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to develop a functioning ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem development is not a linear process with a fixed timeline. The initial alignment and validation phases typically take 3-6 months, while scaling to a minimum viable ecosystem can range from 6 months to 2 years depending on complexity and scope. The goal is not speed but sustainability - creating systems that can thrive independently over time. Throughout our collaboration, we'll establish clear milestones while maintaining the flexibility needed for organic growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of organizations or communities benefit most from ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "Organizations seeking to move beyond traditional hierarchical structures benefit most from ecosystem architecture. This includes forward-thinking businesses, educational initiatives, community projects, and decentralized networks. If you're looking to create a structure that's more organic, values-driven, and resilient than conventional organizational models, ecosystem architecture offers a powerful framework. It's particularly valuable for initiatives that aim to foster innovation, collaboration, and positive societal impact."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you measure the success of an ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Success metrics for ecosystems differ from traditional business KPIs. We focus on indicators like member engagement and contribution, value creation and distribution, adaptability to change, and progress toward shared vision and values. Rather than measuring purely financial outcomes, we evaluate how effectively the ecosystem empowers its members, fosters innovation, and creates sustainable positive impact. During our work together, we'll define specific success metrics aligned with your ecosystem's unique purpose."
