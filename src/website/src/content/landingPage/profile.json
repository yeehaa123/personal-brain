As an **Ecosystem Architect**, I bring people together around common values, discover shared visions, and translate these into effective ecosystems that transcend traditional boundaries of space and time.\n\nWith a PhD in Philosophy from Utrecht University and experience as a researcher and teacher at institutions across the globe (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam, Minneapolis, and DevBootcamp San Francisco), I blend theoretical knowledge with practical application.\n\n### My Approach\n\nI believe in the power of decentralized, regenerative design principles. Rather than working top-down, I cultivate ecosystems that emerge organically through aligned values and collaborative practices. My work focuses on creating environments where:\n\n- Communities thrive through purpose-driven collaboration\n- Innovation emerges from the intersection of diverse perspectives\n- Regenerative practices transform waste into opportunity\n- People discover and develop their unique strengths\n\n### Current Ventures\n\nAs Founder of **Rizom**, I'm creating a community where individuals are empowered to discover their unique strengths and passions. I also founded the **Superconnectors Network**, an event format enabling startups to present their 'critical ask' to the best-connected people in the Dutch tech ecosystem.\n\nMy greatest passion has always been challenging preconceived notions about education and knowledge sharing. I strongly advocate for an impactful and inclusive internet that prioritizes open knowledge over credentials and intellectual property.",

    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing intentional communities and organizations that transcend traditional spatial and temporal boundaries. Unlike biological ecosystems, modern organizational ecosystems can operate across distributed networks and asynchronous timelines. I help design rule systems and governance structures that allow these decentralized organizations to thrive through four key movements: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does your ecosystem architecture approach differ from traditional organizational design?",
        "answer": "Traditional organizational design typically follows hierarchical, top-down structures with rigid boundaries. My ecosystem architecture approach embraces decentralized, regenerative design principles that work bottom-up. Rather than controlling outcomes, I focus on creating the conditions for emergence and self-organization. This approach is particularly effective for organizations operating across fragmented digital landscapes where traditional models often fail."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is your process for developing an ecosystem architecture?",
        "answer": "My process follows four sequential movements: 1) Align - defining values and creating vision types, 2) Validate - building vessels of transformation to test commitment, 3) Scale - iteratively expanding through continued alignment and validation, and 4) Spin Out - letting go to allow the ecosystem to become self-sustaining. Throughout this process, we focus on both conforming to established patterns while strategically breaking rules to foster innovation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to see results from ecosystem architecture work?",
        "answer": "Ecosystem architecture is not a quick-fix solution but rather a transformative process. Initial alignment and validation phases typically take 3-6 months, while scaling to a minimum viable ecosystem can take 1-2 years depending on complexity. However, you'll see incremental progress throughout the journey as we develop vision types and vessels of transformation that demonstrate the potential of your ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with established organizations or only startups?",
        "answer": "I work with both established organizations looking to transform their approach and new ventures seeking to build ecosystem-based models from the ground up. My experience spans traditional institutions, tech startups, community organizations, and decentralized networks. The common thread is a desire to move beyond hierarchical structures toward more organic, value-aligned communities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What industries or sectors do you specialize in?",
        "answer": "While my ecosystem architecture principles apply across sectors, I have particular expertise in education transformation, technology communities, and cultural innovation. My background includes founding Rizom, creating the Superconnectors event format, and working with various educational institutions. I'm especially passionate about projects that challenge conventional wisdom and create positive societal impact."
