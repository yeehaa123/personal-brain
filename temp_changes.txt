// Let's make minimal changes to fix the issues:

1. Add "as unknown as Response" to all Promise.resolve instances:
sed -i 's/return Promise.resolve({/return Promise.resolve({/g; s/});$/} as unknown as Response);/g' tests/mcp/contexts/website/services/netlifyDeploymentService.test.ts

2. Fix URL parameter types:
sed -i 's/mockImplementation((url)/mockImplementation((url: string)/g' tests/mcp/contexts/website/services/netlifyDeploymentService.test.ts
sed -i 's/mockImplementation((url, options)/mockImplementation((url: string, options: any)/g' tests/mcp/contexts/website/services/netlifyDeploymentService.test.ts

3. Fix the fs.readdir mock issue:
sed -i 's/mockReaddir = mock(() => Promise.resolve(\[{/mockReaddir = mock(() => Promise.resolve([{/g' tests/mcp/contexts/website/services/netlifyDeploymentService.test.ts

4. Fix the fs.readFile mock issue:
sed -i 's/mockReadFile = mock(() => Promise.resolve(Buffer.from/mockReadFile = mock(() => Promise.resolve(Buffer.from/g' tests/mcp/contexts/website/services/netlifyDeploymentService.test.ts
