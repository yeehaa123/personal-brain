/**
 * TODO: Matrix test implementation needs refactoring
 * 
 * This test file has been temporarily removed because it was causing conflicts with 
 * the BrainProtocol singleton pattern implementation. The original test used a custom mock
 * implementation that lacked proper resetInstance functionality, which interfered with other tests.
 * 
 * When reimplementing, follow these guidelines:
 * 
 * 1. Use the standard MockBrainProtocol from '@test/__mocks__/protocol/brainProtocol'
 * 2. Avoid extending MockBrainProtocol with custom methods that change its behavior
 * 3. Use test isolation patterns as documented in CLAUDE.md
 * 4. Each test should resetInstance() in beforeEach/afterEach hooks
