/**
 * TODO: Proper tests for BrainProtocol
 * 
 * The BrainProtocol class currently has too many dependencies to effectively test.
 * We need to continue simplifying and refactoring BrainProtocol to make it more testable.
 * 
 * Future test plan:
 * 1. Test initialization and dependency injection
 * 2. Test manager accessor methods
 * 3. Test feature coordination
 * 4. Test async initialization
 * 5. Test query processing with mocked dependencies
